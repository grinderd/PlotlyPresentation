# A little about me before we begin:


Modeler at Bank of America

Avid Star Wars Fan

![](return_of_jedi.jpg)

Amatuer user and ardent supporter of version control in data science

![](git.png)

R user for the last 9 years.

Used R for modeling and development at American Credit Acceptance before coming to Bank of America.

![](ACA.png)

- Introduced and championed Shiny for rapid application development
- Developed various models and process improvements using R tool kit

**Bank of America work:**

![](https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/bank_of_america_logo_animation_new_a.gif)

- Modeling Lead for Consumer Behavior Modeling:
- Worked on Risk Models for a year
- Currently working on Innovation team (Best job I think I will ever have):
  - New modeling ideas
  - New areas of the business that would benefit from modeling knowledge
  - Application of deep learning

# **What is this presenation?**

# **I enjoy the data visualization side of data science**

## **ggplot was always go too for my data science needs**

- simple intuitive syntax to write and read
- wide range of useful geoms to solve common modeling problems
- integrates well with the rest of tidyverse

- (Big step forward from lattice and base graphics)



### **ggplot is an adoption of the precepts laid out in the Grammar of Graphics** 

![](GG_concepts.png)

## ggplot doesn't lend itself to interactivity

- several efforts have introduced interactivity 
  - ggvis
  - rggobi
  - iPlots
  - htmlwidgets
  - r2d3

# htmlwidets and r2d3 are an adaptation of D3/javascript technology

## D3 is a javascript package that is very important in data visualization

- Written in a language that integrates with web development
- Uses data to manipulate the web document through various objects (SVG)
- Released in 2011

### Useful examples of power and interactivity:

# Sunburst Example

# Density over time

# **D3 Pros and Cons**

*Pros*
- Very flexible and portable
- Interactivity part of the dna
- Looks very professional and polished

*Cons*
- Very steep learning curve
  - API requires decent understanding of how javascript
- Centered on webdevelopment instead of data science
- ?Falling out of favor?

## What is the answer?

# **Plot.ly is a solution with a simpler API and out of the box interactivity**

Essentially plot.ly is API wrapper for several D3


# **How does the plotly package work**

Key to understading package is understanding how it transforms the data

- Data enters in R formats
- Transformed to list format 
- Tranformed to JSON format

Below is a useful diagram showing how the final presentation is done.

![](plotly_data_transform.svg)

**Plotly uses two key components:**

1. Data/Trace:
  - Connection between data and visuals
  - Traces have types (scatter plot, histograms, sunburst, etc.)
  - Trace types have specific atttributes that can be defined.
2. Layout


# **ggplotly() to the rescue**

If you have plots in ggplot, you can start using plotly with just a simple function call on most ggplot objects.


Let's make a ggplot from Propser data.  
```{r}
amt_fin_p = pros_agg%>%
  ggplot(aes(origination_date,avg_amt_borrowed))+
  geom_line(aes(color = prosper_rating))

amt_fin_p
```

Simple ggplotly command adds the tooltip, zooming, 

```{r}
ggplotly(amt_fin_p)
```

Now the plotly syntax:

```{r}
pros_agg%>%
  plot_ly(x = ~origination_date, y = ~avg_amt_borrowed, color = ~prosper_rating, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines')
#  add_lines(color = ~prosper_rating)
```




```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
```{r}

```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
